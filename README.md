## Description

In this application, I have added functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.  The user is be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an internet connection. When entering transactions offline, they are saved and populate the total when brought back online.

## Installation

All you need to do is click the link.

## Usage

When the user opens the app, they are displayed with their current budget.  They are able to add transactions and click either Add or Subtract Funds.  The user can also use this app without an internet connection.  Any transactions made online will be saved in pending IndexedDB.  Once the user is back online, when they reload the page twice, those transactions will be added to the MongoDB Atlas DB.
